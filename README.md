cyo-backbone-with-coffee
========================

My initial attempt at the Choose Your Own Application project, using backbone.js with coffeescript and Node.js for the server.

The source of this rather interesting approach to learning ways that different JavaScript-centric libraries and tools can be combined can be found at http://chooseyourownapplication.com

Enjoy!
